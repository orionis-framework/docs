## 🌟 What is Orionis?

Orionis is not just a framework: it's a revolution. Born from the desire to empower an exceptional team of developers, it bridges the familiar with the future.

Imagine a team of PHP experts, masters of precision and agility, facing a new technological frontier. The challenges—RPA, AI, Blockchain, Data Analytics, OCR, and Computer Vision—demanded more than skill; they required new tools. Enter Python: versatile, powerful, and ready to tackle the future.

Built upon the methodology the team already mastered, Orionis captures the essence of their workflow and reinvents it in Python. With Orionis, the leap to Python is more than a technological change: it's a journey of empowerment.
