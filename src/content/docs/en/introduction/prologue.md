# Welcome to Orionis
## Build without limits. Revolutionize your development.

![Orionis Framework Logo](/prologue/logo.png)

Orionis is not just a framework: it’s a revolution. Born from the desire to empower an exceptional team of developers, it bridges the familiar with the future.

Imagine a team of PHP experts, masters of precision and agility, facing a new technological frontier. The challenges—RPA, AI, Blockchain, Data Analytics, OCR, and Computer Vision—demanded more than skill; they required new tools. Enter Python: versatile, powerful, and ready to tackle the future.

But the leap to Python was more than learning a new language; it was adopting a new mindset. Questions arose:

- How do we structure classes naturally?
- How do we manage the lifecycle of a Request?
- And Middleware, the backbone of robust applications?

The answer was to create something extraordinary: a framework that feels like home.

Thus, Orionis was born.

Built upon the methodology the team already mastered, Orionis captures the essence of their workflow and reinvents it in Python. The result? A seamless transition that accelerates adaptation and turns developers into active creators of their own solutions.

With Orionis, the leap to Python is more than a technological change: it’s a journey of empowerment. It’s a community where craftsmanship meets science, elevating development to new heights within Python’s powerful ecosystem.

Orionis is not just a framework—it’s the starting point for building extraordinary applications, without limits or complications. Imagine an environment where you can build APIs, websites, sockets, queues, jobs, scheduled tasks, and commands, all ready for you to focus solely on your business logic. Develop fast, innovate effortlessly.
