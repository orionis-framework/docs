## What is Orionis?

Orionis is born from a vision: to facilitate the leap of an exceptionally talented team of developers to a new technological horizon without losing their ability to make an impact. This team was skilled in PHP and mastered a framework that allowed them to create with precision and agility. However, as we looked ahead, we realized that the challenges we aimed to tackle, such as RPA, AI, Blockchain, Data Analytics, OCR, and Computer Vision, required something more: we needed the versatility and power of Python.

When the team faced the task of building a new architecture in Python, we understood that the transition was not just about language but also about mindset. Python, with its different approach to structure and application lifecycle, raised questions for which we needed a specific solution: How do we organize classes in a natural way? How do we manage the lifecycle of a Request? And what about Middleware, so essential in robust applications? Each element that they had mastered in the PHP ecosystem now posed a learning curve.

Then the key question emerged: “What if we build something in Python that feels like home?” Thus, Orionis was born. We based this new framework on the methodology the team already mastered, capturing the essence of their workflow in a Python environment. We began developing the initial functionalities, tailored to their strengths and habits, and soon we provided them with a version to test. The result was surprising: they not only adapted quickly but also began to understand the why and how of each step. Instead of simply "using" a tool, they became active participants in a solution that not only facilitated their transition but also empowered them on their journey into Python.

Orionis is more than just a framework; it is a community that transforms the transition from a simple technological leap into a complete evolution of skills, elevating web craftsmanship to a scientific level within the powerful ecosystem of Python.
